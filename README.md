1.What is Exploratory Data Analysis ?

Exploratory Data Analysis or (EDA) is understanding the data sets by summarizing their main characteristics often plotting them visually. This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning. Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data. Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important.

2.How to perform Exploratory Data Analysis ?

This is one such question that everyone is keen on knowing the answer. Well, the answer is it depends on the data set that you are working. There is no one method or common methods in order to perform EDA, whereas in this tutorial you can understand some common methods and plots that would be used in the EDA process.

3.What data do I explore?

The data-set can be downloaded from here. To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data contains more of 10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns.This dataset contains of individuals who have completed their Bachelor's degree and are deciding whether to pursue an MBA. It includes demographic information, academic background, work experience, financial factors, and career aspirations to analyze trends and key drivers behind MBA decisions.
